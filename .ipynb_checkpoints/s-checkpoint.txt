The SemLink annotations (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-clear/semlink/master/other_resources/1.2.2c.okay) provide partial information to link between FrameNet, an ontology, and DeepBank, an annotated corpus.

Some sentences in Penn TreeBank WSJ session have semantics annotations from two sources: (1) ERG semantic analysis (from DeepBank) and (2) PropBank-SemLink-FrameNet analysis.
For the second analysis, the SemLink project augments PropBank annotations by adding FrameNet information. The information provided by SemLink is in the following format:

nw/wsj/00/wsj_0001.parse 0 8 gold join-v 22.1-2-1 Cause_to_amalgamate join.01 null ----- 0:2-ARG0=Agent;Agent 7:0-ARGM-MOD 8:0-rel 9:1-ARG1=Patient;Part_1 11:1-ARGM-PRD 15:1-ARGM-TMP

nw: newswire;
00: PennTree section 00;
wsj_0001: file/document ID;
0: sentence ID, i.e. the first sentence in document wsj_0001;
8: token ID, i.e. the ninth token of this sentence;
gold: manually annotated;
join-v 22.1-2-1: VerbNet class (irrelevant to this coursework)
Cause_to_amalgamate: FrameNet frame (this information should be used to augment DeepBank analysis)
join.01: PropBank word sense;
0:2-ARG0=Agent;Agent: the node 0:2 in the corresponding Penn TreeBank tree is the argument of the ninth word join; ARG0 is the PropBank role, the first Agent is the VerbNet role and the second Agent is the FrameNet role; (the FrameNet information should be used to augment DeepBank analysis)
...
9:1-ARG1=Patient;Part_1: In this item, Part_1 is the FrameNet role.

As I answered in the classroom, no manual annotation is needed in this task. The existing information provided by SemLink should be automatically project to DeepBank annotations. Missing information from SemLink should be automatically predicted based on existing annotations.

No evaluation is necessary as described in the instruction and as emphasised in the classroom.
